Lots of factors made this otherwise runnable trail a bear at night: blowdown, climbing, mad temperature swings, variable water access.

Both of them handled it totally perfectly. Even when things got a bit hairy at the end and had to link up after getting a bit turned around in the last mi.

John, you’re a complete animal. Turned around after what sounded to be a heinous 70 mi push with minimal water access to full recovery mode, napping and then back out on course in a couple hours is unheard of.

Still processing the magnitude of his effort

Also felt pretty safe and chill at night which is a huge plus. May have actually seen an Elk!? It was huge and not the normal coloring of a white or black tail. Nice and warm but pretty wet.

Definitely took note of the fact that the bedrock is pretty varied. One nice ankle roll but honestly compared to other high use trails that get rutted or have lots of exposed roots, super minor.

Wonderful night !
